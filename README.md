Knights Tour in FSharp
=======================

The "Knight's Tour" is an ancient puzzle with the objective to move a knight piece, starting from any square of chess board, to every other square, landing on each square only once. 

Having written a Knights Tour solution in various languages previously I thought I should attempt a version in F# whilst trying learn the functional programming paradigm and F# language
